Hey there, I'm Vasilis! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a Computer Science graduate from Greece ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡·, now pursuing a Master of Management in Analytics at McGill University in Montreal ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. 
My focus lies in **machine learning and data analytics**, where I explore how data and models can drive meaningful impact. 
Through projects in sales forecasting, AI assistants, and predictive modeling, 
Iâ€™ve been building the technical and analytical toolkit needed to turn complex datasets into actionable insights.

As a former entrepreneur, I founded and ran a cafÃ©-restaurant in Montreal, where I learned firsthand how to use data to guide business decisions.
That experience shaped my ability to connect numbers with strategy, while developing resilience, adaptability, and leadership skills that I now bring into every project. 
My journey has shown me the power of combining technical solutions with a deep understanding of real-world needs â€” and itâ€™s what drives my commitment to AI and data science today. ðŸ’¡

Beyond data, Iâ€™m deeply curious about personal growth and continuous learning.
I enjoy exploring the intersections between business, technology, and human behavior, and Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to expand my perspective.  

As a fun fact: I used to be a young professional soccer player, which instilled discipline and focus into my daily life. Also, I'm a foodie.

Letâ€™s connect and drive business impact with data & AI together!
